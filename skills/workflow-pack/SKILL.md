# Workflow Pack

Discover, adapt, and release reusable workflow packs in Epismo — from finding a community pattern to publishing a proven execution structure.

**Core principle: reuse before creating. Search private → liked → public before building anything new.**

## NEW

**Goal:** create a reusable workflow as a private pack. Reuse before building — scan for an existing pattern first.

### Step 1 — Reuse scan

Infer 2–4 topic keywords from the user's intent. Search in this order:

```bash
# 1. Your own private workflows
epismo pack search --type workflow --query "<topic>" --filter '{"visibility":["private"]}'

# 2. Workflows you bookmarked
epismo pack search --type workflow --filter '{"like":"liked"}'

# 3. Community public workflows
epismo pack search --type workflow --query "<topic>" --filter '{"visibility":["public"]}'
```

| Result        | Action                                                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strong match  | Fetch full content → adapt steps → [Step 3 — Create](#step-3--create)      |
| Partial match | Fetch → use as base, modify steps → [Step 3 — Create](#step-3--create)     |
| No match      | Design steps from scratch → [Step 2 — Design steps](#step-2--design-steps) |

### Step 2 — Design steps

Each step should:

- Have a clear title and self-contained content
- Assign an owner: `human` for decisions/reviews, AI agent name for generation/research
- Declare `dependsOn` only when execution genuinely requires a prior step

### Adapting a found workflow

Before materializing:

1. Identify steps to keep, modify, or remove.
2. Strip project-specific names, IDs, and one-off constraints.
3. Reassign owners as appropriate for the new context.
4. Confirm destination: private pack for future reuse, or project tracks for immediate execution.

Use [Workflow Patterns — Discovery](./templates/patterns.md#2-workflow-discovery) for structured adaptation reports.

### Step 3 — Create

Default `private`. Use [RELEASE](#release) to publish publicly.

`create pack`:

```json
{
  "title": "<title>",
  "content": "<description>",
  "type": "workflow",
  "visibility": "private",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "s001",
      "title": "<step title>",
      "content": "<step instructions>",
      "dueDate": "",
      "dependsOn": [],
      "parentId": "",
      "assignee": "human"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Who needs it | `visibility` | `projects[]` |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Just me      | `"private"`  | omit         |
| My team      | `"private"`  | `["pj_xxx"]` |

```
workflow  <workflow-id>  <workflow-title>
step      <step-id>      <step-title>
```

---

## GET

**Goal:** fetch a workflow by ID, alias, or explicit read/open target.

### Route intent before resolving

Prefer **alias-first** unless the input is obviously a search query.

| Input pattern                                                          | Route         | Why                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `get ...`, `use ...`, `load ...`, `open ...`, `read ...`               | [GET](#get)   | Explicit retrieval                            |
| `find ...`, `search ...`, `what workflows do I have`, `show workflows` | [FIND](#find) | Explicit discovery                            |
| Bare UUID                                                              | [GET](#get)   | IDs are unambiguous                           |
| Bare alias-shaped token                                                | [GET](#get)   | Try alias first, then search if it misses     |
| Short ambiguous phrase                                                 | [GET](#get)   | Try alias first, then search if it misses     |
| Obvious search query, question, or long descriptive phrase             | [FIND](#find) | Discovery intent is clearer than alias intent |

### Resolve the input

1. UUID → `get pack --id`.
2. `@handle/name` or one compact token like `prd-review` → `get pack --alias`; if it misses, run [FIND](#find) with the same text.
3. Short phrase like `deployment checklist` → try `get pack --alias` first; if it misses, run [FIND](#find).
4. Question, explicit search wording, or long descriptive text → [FIND](#find) first.
5. `get/read/open/use <target>` always counts as retrieval intent.

`get pack` — default returns outline only; pass `--full` for all steps, or `--step-id` to load specific steps.

```bash
epismo pack get --id <pack-id> --full
epismo pack get --alias <alias> --full
epismo pack get --id <pack-id> --step-id <step-id-1>,<step-id-2>
```

---

## FIND

**Goal:** discover the right workflow when the ID is not known.

`search pack` — scan titles only (no step content). Use this for natural-language discovery requests and multi-keyword topic phrases. Search in this order:

1. `type: workflow`, `query: <topic>`, `filter: { visibility: ["private"] }`
2. `type: workflow`, `query: <topic>`, `filter: { like: "liked" }`
3. `type: workflow`, `query: <topic>`, `filter: { visibility: ["public"] }`

Present the title list; if the match is clear, `get pack` immediately.

For filter keys, sort options, and search recipes, see [Search & Discovery](./references/search.md).

---

## UPDATE

**Goal:** edit the steps or metadata of an existing workflow.

### ID or alias known

Always fetch before writing.

`get pack` → inspect current steps and metadata → `update pack` with `id` and step operations using `op` fields.

For `update <alias> based on this conversation`:

- modify the steps where the new guidance belongs
- add new steps only for new execution work
- keep `dependsOn`, ownership, and ordering coherent

### ID unknown

1. `search pack` — `type: workflow`, `query: <inferred topic>`, `filter: { visibility: ["private"] }`, `sort: updatedAt:desc`
2. **One clear match** → fetch and update without asking.
3. **Multiple candidates** → show titles and IDs, ask the user to pick.
4. **No match** → fall back to [NEW](#new).

**"Last workflow" shortcut:** sort `updatedAt:desc`, take the first result.

```
workflow  <workflow-id>  <workflow-title>
step      <step-id>      <step-title>    # when a specific step was updated
```

---

## ORGANIZE

**Goal:** improve the step structure of an existing workflow.

`get pack --full` → review all steps → apply changes → `update pack`.

| Situation                                       | Action                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A step is too broad or covers multiple concerns | **Split** — divide into two focused steps                           |
| Two steps overlap or one has become redundant   | **Merge** — combine into one coherent step, remove the other        |
| A step is no longer relevant                    | **Remove** — delete the step from the workflow                      |
| Steps are out of execution order                | **Reorder** — update `dependsOn` chains to reflect correct sequence |
| The whole workflow is obsolete                  | **Delete** — requires explicit user approval                        |

All changes are applied via `update pack` using `op` fields. Use `"op": "add"` for new steps, `"op": "update"` for existing ones, `"op": "remove"` to delete a step by ID. `delete pack` requires explicit user approval.

---

## RELEASE

**Goal:** publish a workflow publicly, update an existing release, or deprecate an obsolete one.

Two paths:

| Situation                               | Path                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Existing private workflow worth sharing | Promote — change visibility to `public`          |
| New content written for community reuse | Create new public workflow via [NEW](#new) first |

### Step 1 — Quality Gate

Run [Quality Gate](./references/quality.md) before any release decision. All 8 criteria must pass for public release. A single fail means: fix or keep private.

### Step 2 — Release decision

| Decision       | When                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `release`      | Execution proven, structure generalizable, no superior equivalent exists |
| `update`       | Improves an existing released pattern without breaking consumers         |
| `keep private` | Evidence incomplete or quality gate has open items                       |
| `deprecate`    | Obsolete, unsafe, or superseded                                          |

Run the pre-decision checks in [Release](./references/release.md) before choosing one of these paths.

### Step 3 — Confirm and update

**Confirm with user before writing:** state the workflow title, ID, and target visibility.

`update pack`:

```json
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "visibility": "public",
  "category": "<category>"
}
```

| Category       | When to use                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `productivity` | Daily rhythms, time management, operating norms         |
| `programming`  | Code review, deployment, testing, development workflows |
| `design`       | Component reviews, UX research, design system processes |
| `marketing`    | Campaign planning, content creation, launch workflows   |
| `operations`   | Incident response, onboarding, deployment pipelines     |
| `learning`     | Onboarding guides, skill-building, training workflows   |
| `life`         | Personal productivity, non-work routines                |

See [Release](./references/release.md) for the approval boundary and required output format.

```
workflow  <workflow-id>  <workflow-title>
share     https://epismo.ai/hub/workflows/<id>
```

---

## Write Safety

1. **Default private** — `new` and `update` always write private. Use [RELEASE](#release) to go public.
2. **No silent writes** — if scope is unclear, ask once before writing.
3. **Approval required** — public publication, deprecation, and overwriting another owner's workflow require explicit user confirmation before writing.

For the full approval matrix, see [Visibility & Sharing — Approval Boundary](./references/visibility.md#approval-boundary).

---

## Operation Output

After every operation, return in this order:

1. **Workflow and step** — return both ID and title at each level affected
2. **What changed** — one sentence
3. **Next action** — single most useful next step (omit if none)

```
workflow  <workflow-id>  <workflow-title>
step      <step-id>      <step-title>    # when a specific step was created or updated
```

Skip analysis and evidence unless the user asked for it.
